## Face Classification (c++)

This repository has been created as an attempt to solve classification of an image into face and non-face using 3 different techniques listed below:

1. Simple Gaussian Model
2. Mixture of Gaussian Model
3. t-distribution Model


Similar to https://github.com/Arshita27/Face_Classification_1, the algorithms, mentioned above, are implemenetd from scratch using libraries like Opencv in C++.
